Team members had recieved confirmation of what project they were doing; recieved our first choice which was project 1. 
Team members arrived and began to work through ideas for potential question for the upcoming meeting with the client. 
Meeting was scheduled at 15:20-15:40.
We worked through our 1 hour 20 minutes of prep time by collaborating and working out questions; we decided to narrow it down to questions on users interacting with the program, softwares already in use by the client to ensure compatibility, interfacing and a couple others. 
We allocated our team members to ask a question each at least to ensure we all got the information we needed to work efficiently on our project. 
We met with the client at around 15:20 who introduced himself and told us about what he expected with the required software. 
We both voice recorded and took notes on what he replied and told us about so we did not miss any crucial information. 

Plan for Next Week: 
Discuss role allocations for each team member based on strengths.
Confirm all requirements with client and within group so everyone is on track.
