Team members introduced themselves to one another; looked over the project options given on canvas. 
We worked through all of them and evaluated which ones out of the five we would like to do but also how they would suit each out strengths. 
We came to the conclusion that projects 1, 5 and 2 respectively would be the best choices in accordance to our team strengths but also our liking. 
We then collaborated and wrote our Project Justification in which we all showcased the mentioned strengths and why we should have our first choice. 

Plan for Next Week: 
Recieve project allocations and begin working towards our project. 
Draw up and confirm potential questions to ask our client who we will be meting next week.
